# TABSA-BERT

This repository contains the implementation of BERT models for Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (TABSA), trained and tested on the SentiHood Dataset.
The goal is: to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity.

This repository is used as an attachment for the final project of the Advanced Information-Retrieval (IR) course (2022).

The title of the mini final project is: "Pemanfaatan BERT pada Targeted Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis melalui pembuatan Auxiliary Sentence"
